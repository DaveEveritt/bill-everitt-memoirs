### Road-building

Most side roads were either cobbled in the older areas or, on the new estates, were stone covered in black ash which was the foundation for the future tarred finish. The roads were compacted by fascinating steam rollers which chugged forward for about fifty yards and then reversed. The roadstone and the surface materials were distributed by gangs of men, the whole operational cycle being labour orientated. Work was never rushed and was carried out at a leisurely pace, although the working day and week were quite long. All roadworks were guarded at night by a night watchman who had a small canvas shelter and a brazier with a roaring coke fire just in front. Most watchmen were old men past their working life. They were glad of the company of anyone who, on their way home from work, would sit with them and chat, and warm themselves ready for the completion of their walk home from work.

### Friends and neighbours just before school

Shortly before starting school I found that the other children in the street were either friends or enemies. Reg Cooper was one of the first I knew, as my mother was a great friend of Mrs. Cooper who was older and wiser than her and, after the scalding of my shoulder, they became quite close friends and consequently we knew the children: Mabel, Reg and later on Tommy who died of meningitis while still a child. Reg was older than me so I was always slightly frightened of him. Further up the street lived Fred Soars and Ken Frost. They were more my age so a natural affinity developed between us. Fred was a great friend up until the second world war when he went into the army, serving in Italy where he was wounded. After the war he married one of the group of girls we knew, and I am sad to say we lost contact.
