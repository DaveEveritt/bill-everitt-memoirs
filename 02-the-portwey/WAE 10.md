Bessie and when she came she brought her sewing machine which originally had been aunts, it was a hand machine and when Aunt Em left to go and live with my uncle frank my mother bought her machine and  I have lots of memories of having to try on various half finished garments and waiting impatiently for new shirts and trousers etc. 11 wasn't until 1 had been about two years at school that 1 got my first new shop-bought clothes.The house, semi-detached stood back from the road a fence on the right hand side and a fence at the far end of the back garden separated us from the fields.
