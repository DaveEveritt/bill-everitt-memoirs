### Road-building

Most side roads were either cobbled in the older areas or, on the new estates, were stone covered in black ash which was the foundation for the future tarred finish. The roads were compacted by fascinating steam rollers which chugged forward for about fifty yards and then reversed. The roadstone and the surface materials were distributed by gangs of men, the whole operational cycle being labour orientated. Work was never rushed and was carried out at a leisurely pace, although the working day and week were quite long. All roadworks were guarded at night by a night watchman who had a small canvas shelter and a brazier with a roaring coke fire just in front. Most watchmen were old men past their working life. They were glad of the company of anyone who, on their way home from work, would sit with them and chat, and warm themselves ready for the completion of their walk home from work.
