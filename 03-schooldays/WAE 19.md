Have we influenced our children and grand children in the same way. I wouldn't think so as conversation and social relationships have broken down and it is possible that parental and family influence has been replaced by firstly the cinema and radio and in later years by television and video and to come right up to date by computers, the internet and video games I wonder what the next a stage will be; virtual reality on DVD possibly?
