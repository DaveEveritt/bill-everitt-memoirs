The semi-detached house stood back from the road; a fence on the right hand side and a fence at the far end of the back garden separated us from the fields. Directly facing the back door was a high wooden fence for privacy, not that great store was placed on privacy—neighbours were frequent visitors to each others’ doors in search of wandering children, and messages were relayed to other children by this means. Even when quite small the street was as much a playground as the garden, although it was around about 1930 that Humberstone park was opened.

The treat on a Saturday or a Sunday night was a walk across the fields to Humberstone village, which had two public houses: the Plough, which according to many sold the best beer and kept it the best; and a quaint thatched country public house, the Windmill, which was the families’ choice because it had a garden so you could sit outside. It seems funny to reminisce, as the evenings always seemed to be sunny and the general atmosphere was always friendly and convivial with impromptu singsongs and organised games for children. Money was quite scarce so drunkeness was always minimal, except for one or two characters who shall be nameless, although even that was non-aggressive. I suppose, because the majority of the men were old soldiers who were used to the camaraderie of the trenches, this was to carry through to a civilian life of mutual help and friendship. I remember the long walk back down the hill, across by the asylum, and being carried the last piece by my father, half awake, half asleep, and then being put to bed in utter contentment. Is it imagination?

## An accident-prone best freind

My special friend was Fred Soars and, up to the time he was called up for the second war, we were absolutely inseparable—even to the point of us both being apprenticed to the same trade and spending our lives in the printing industry. It was Fred who had a serious accident coming home one Saturday night. He and Reg Cooper were racing down the Humberstone Hill and collided with a car. He was in the infirmary for a while but came out a hero in our eyes, with broken bones and a large gash on his chin, a scar he carried for the rest of his life. Fred was always the instigator of what we did, but was always prone to something happening to him. I doubt if even he could tell you the number of times he broke his arm. He always seemed to be in plaster for some reason or another. It must have had an effect on his health as he was sent to the open air school at Western Park to be “built up” (as it was phrased then).
